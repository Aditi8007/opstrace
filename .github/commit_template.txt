## Example first line: "bump: update Node to v42.0".
##
## Specifically, the first line should contain a type and a description
## of the change being made.
##
## Change types:
## - arch: large architectural changes/refactors (potentially breaking)
## - bump: third-party lib/component bump (can be big, including Cortex, ...)
## - chore: small routine tasks, very localized refactors
## - ci: change to automated CI pipeline
## - cli: change to the cluster management CLI (create, destroy, ..., )
## - cortex: change to cortex (config change for example)
## - controller: change in the k8s controller CLI
## - dashboards: e.g. change to grafana dashboards for system monitoring
## - docs: any documentation change
## - feat: user-facing feature addition. Makes most sense in a semver world which we are not yet in.
## - fix: fix for user-facing issue in the opstrace system (fix user-facing bug). Makes most sense in a semver world which we are not yet in.
## - installer: change in installer (cluster creation)
## - looker: change to looker project
## - loki: change to loki (config change for example)
## - makefile: change in main Makefile
## - perf: user-facing performance tweak. Makes most sense in a semver world which we are not yet in.
## - revert: specifically for a git revert commit
## - systemlogs: change in opstrace system log arch/implementation
## - test-remote: change in test-remote project
## - test-scale: perhaps this could be a type?
## - ui: any changes relating to the app package
## - uninstaller: change in uninstaller (cluster destruction/teardown)
## - website: change in the website code or content
## - wip: work in progress, later to be edited/squashed ("i don't want to think about choosing the right prefix now!")
##
## See https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ for background.
##
## The first line should also:
## - be at most 89 characters long
## - contain a description that is at most 72 characters long
## - not end with sentence-ending punctuation
## - start (after the type) with a lowercase imperative ("add", "fix")
##
## The second line should be empty, per normal Git convention. The
## remaining lines should be limited to a reasonable length (72
## characters is common), though there's currently no enforcement for
## that.
